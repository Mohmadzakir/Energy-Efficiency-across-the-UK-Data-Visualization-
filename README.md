# Data Visualization Coursework

## 📋 Project Description
This project focuses on visualizing carbon dioxide emissions across the UK based on property types, energy efficiency, tenure, and location. Developed using Power BI, the dashboard includes interactive elements such as filters, tooltips, and time sliders to enhance user experience and facilitate data exploration.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Interactive Map:** Displays CO₂ emissions by property type using color gradients and bubble sizes.
- **Trend Analysis:** Line charts to track energy efficiency evolution across regions and property types.
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Scatter plots to identify correlations among property type, tenure, location, energy efficiency, and CO₂ emissions.
- **Consistent Design:** Utilizes cohesive color schemes, fonts, and clear legends for readability.

## 📊 Data Sources
- BEIS (2021). "UK Emissions by Sector and Property Type." [UK National Statistics](https://www.gov.uk)
- Chen, J., Li, R., & Sun, W. (2016). "Spatial Visualization of Carbon Emissions Using GIS."
- Additional references include works by Ware (2013), Tufte (2001), and Few (2006).

## 🖥️ Dashboard Preview
Include a screenshot or a GIF of your dashboard here if possible.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Power BI:** For creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards.
- **Data Sources:** CSV files with information on carbon emissions, property types, and energy efficiency.
- **Graphic Design Principles:** Consistent use of color, alignment, and visual hierarchy.


## 🖱️ Usage
- Use filters to view emissions by specific regions or property types.
- Hover over data points for detailed tooltips.
- Use the time slider to track energy efficiency changes over the years.

## 📊 Key Insights
- High CO₂ emissions are concentrated in certain regions and property types.
- Energy efficiency trends vary significantly by location and property type.
- Correlations exist between property tenure, location, and emission levels.

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional data sources for more comprehensive analysis.
- Enhance interactive elements for deeper user exploration.
